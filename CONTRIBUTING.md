### <ins>Issues</ins>

#### Create a new issue

Before making a new issue, make sure there is no duplicate of the issue. If there is no existing issue for the problem
create one using the [issue form](https://github.com/teoh4770/Pomotama/issues/new).

**New Issue Checklist**:

-   [ ] Issue is not duplicated
-   [ ] Descripting Title
-   [ ] Description of the problem/feature
-   [ ] Steps to replicate problem (if applicable)
-   [ ] Assign correct labels

#### Work on an issue

For this project, in general, we don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue that you can work on, you can assign yourself to the issue. Make sure to link your development branch to the issue.

### <ins>Branching</ins>

As a general rule, always branch off from `main`. If you need a specific feature that is being worked on, you can branch off from that but make sure to note down which one has to be merged first in the PR.

#### Name a branch

Here is the convention we have for branch names:

-   `feature/issue-number/description`
-   `bugfix/issue-number/description`
-   `doc/issue-number/description`
-   `refactor/issue-number/description`
-   `release/version`

A very simple example: `feature/1/register-form`

### <ins>Pull Requests</ins>

Pull request checklist:

-   [ ] Does my PR have an appropriate title?
-   [ ] Is my PR up to date with `main` and there are no merge conflict?
