React components are classified into two types:
1. container components
2. presentation components

for example: 
TodoList component = presentation components, show a list of TodoList
and
TodoApp page = container component, provide the todo object data to TodoList component

main js file should be clean (only use to initiate the app)
dom controller file provides the functions that handle the ui and the event handlers
relationship: dom controller file provides the funciton to main js to handle the ui and the event handlers.

the dom controller will use the other controller to handle the CRUD operations + other operations
for example, if the app is use to manage inventory, then inventory controller is created, the global variable is 
save in the inventory controller

(controlling the ui and the user event + handlers)
